        <p align="center"> Over the past four years, I have worked in a chemistry lab at least once a week. 
		I have gathered many skills from this experience that I will use throughout my work as Lab assistant. Skills I have gained include, safe and 
		efficient use of chemicals and equipment regularly used within a chemistry lab setting, confidence in carrying out experiments independently and working well as a team with fellow students.</p>

         <h4 style="color:#9966cc"; > Waitress at Zucchinis </h4>
         <p align="center">I have worked in Zucchinis Restaurant for three years and have gained many useful skills needed within the workplace.

    <h3 style="color:#9966cc"; >Project on How Epstein Barr Virus Triggers Rheumatoid Arthritis.</h3>
    <p align="justify">In my third year of University I completed a project on how the body reacts to Epstein Barr Virus(EBV) and how this virus triggers Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 
	years after they have been exposed to EBV and<br>rote my dissertation on this topic. I researched using many science based websites such as pubmed 
	and compared different results from relevant research projects and drew up outcomes and possible solutions to RA.

     <h3 style="color:#9966cc"; >Project on Biologics For Rheumatoid Arthritis.</h3>
     <p align="justify">For my final year project in University I researched Biologics For Rheumatoid Arthritis RA, as this is a topic of great interest to me. 
	 RA is a debilitating diease that is affected by autoantibodies produced in the body and these trigger cytokines that induce inflammation and lead to increased swelling and pain in the synovial joints.
	 Biologics are drugs that are made to inhibit these processes that increase the pathogenesis of RA.
